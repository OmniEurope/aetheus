# --- Demo TLS: keep the trust anchor equal to the certificate actually served.
#     Dockerfile.vpssim generates the self-signed demo pair into /etc/letsencrypt, which is a NAMED
#     VOLUME. A fresh volume receives the image copy, but an existing one masks it: after an image
#     rebuild the box trusts the anchor baked in the new image while Apache still serves the older
#     certificate from the volume, and the deployment probes fail with "The SSL connection could not
#     be established" (nightly run 1220: anchor D5:C7..., served 7B:6F...). Anchoring the certificate
#     that is really on disk removes the drift in both directions.
#     This is not a TLS relaxation: the probes still require a valid chain, the simulated host simply
#     provides the root for the certificate it serves, which a real Let's Encrypt host gets for free.
