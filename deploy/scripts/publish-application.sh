# Publishes on the HOST what the application images used to rebuild from source inside Docker.
#
# The pipeline already compiled the whole solution in Release before this point. Every `dotnet
# publish` the two Dockerfiles ran then compiled the SAME sources a second time, from a cold
# obj/ inside the build container: measured on 2026-09-07, the backend publish took 88.6 s and the
# EF bundle 64.5 s in Docker, on top of a build the run had already paid for. The frontend paid it
# twice over, since a Blazor WebAssembly publish is the slowest of them all.
#
# What stays in Docker on purpose: the two agent publishes. They are self-contained, single-file
# outputs for two different runtime identifiers, and the Windows one is packaged with `zip`, a tool
# no `ensure-*` script provisions on a build agent. Moving them would trade a real dependency on the
# host for a smaller gain than the three publishes here.
#
# Inputs come from the environment so the caller stays a five-line step:
#   DOTNET         path to the pinned SDK (deploy/scripts/ensure-dotnet-sdk.sh)
#   APP_VERSION    version stamped into the assemblies
# Output layout, consumed verbatim by deploy/docker/Dockerfile.back and Dockerfile.front:
#   <output>/backend/        framework-dependent linux-x64 publish of Aetheus.Back
#   (the EF migrations bundle stays in Docker, see below)
#   <output>/frontend/       the published Blazor WebAssembly site (wwwroot and its siblings)
#   <output>/static-server/  the ASP.NET host that serves it
