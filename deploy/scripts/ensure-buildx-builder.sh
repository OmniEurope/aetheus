# two dotnet publishes at the same time. That is exactly what we want on the production VPS and
# exactly what kills the build on a small host: on the 4 GB mirror VM the kernel OOM-killer took out
# `csc` mid-compile and the step surfaced only as `ResourceExhausted`. Capping the worker serialises
# those stages; it changes no gate, no test and no output, only how many run concurrently.
