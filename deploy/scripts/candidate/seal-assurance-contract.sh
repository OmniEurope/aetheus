# Seals the candidate's assurance contract: what was analysed, what was tested, at which profile, and
# the verdict that decides whether this package may be deployed at all. The contract is signed with a
# SHA-256 and read back at the deployment boundary, so this is the step that makes a candidate
# deployable or not.
#
# This was 56 lines inlined in .pipeline/aetheus-candidate.yaml. The body is relocated unchanged apart
# from the three parameter reads, noted below.
#
# Inputs, all read from the environment (none positional):
#   WORKSPACE                          the run's checkout (required, used through the working directory)
#   BUILD_SOURCEVERSION                the immutable revision this candidate packages
#   AETHEUS_PROFILE                    light or full; recorded in the contract and checked on reading.
#                                      It was written `${{ parameters.profile }}` in the YAML, which
#                                      the control plane expands before execution and a script cannot
#                                      read: inside a `.sh` that same text is a bad substitution and
#                                      aborts the step. The pipeline already publishes the parameter
#                                      under this name, so the value is read from it here.
#   AETHEUS_PERFORMANCE_ENABLED        whether performance qualification is required. Same trap: it
#                                      was `${{ parameters.performance }}`, and the pipeline already
#                                      publishes the parameter under this name.
#   ALLOW_BOOTSTRAP                    the run's allowBootstrap parameter. Same trap, but no pipeline
#                                      variable carries it, so the calling step passes it by name.
#   AETHEUS_RESUME_SOURCE_RUN_ID       the run a checkpoint resume reused, when there was one
#   AETHEUS_CHECKPOINT_*_RUN_ID        the CI, Quality and Security runs a resume reused
#
# Publishes CANDIDATE_ASSURANCE_GRADE, CANDIDATE_DEPLOYABLE and CANDIDATE_BLOCKING_TESTS.

# required test must have produced real evidence, so a technical fault still fails here.
# A test that ran and failed is graded F and sealed into the contract instead of killing a
# two-hour qualification: the candidate records what the code is worth, it does not judge
# whether it may ship. The threshold therefore stays F here, deliberately permissive. The
