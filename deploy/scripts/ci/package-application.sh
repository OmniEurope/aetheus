# Packages the exact application that CI just validated: publishes the .NET output on the runner,
# builds the three images from it, exports and verifies their archives, and seals the delivery
# contract and the artifact provenance over the result.
#
# This was 184 lines inlined in .pipeline/aetheus-ci.yaml, the largest shell block in the repository
# and the one that decides what reaches production. A pipeline definition is not versioned, not
# tested and not reusable: moved here, it can at least be read, linted and called by another
# pipeline. Its behaviour is unchanged by the move, deliberately: this is a relocation, not a
# rewrite. The one substitution is the embedded JavaScript heredoc, now
# deploy/scripts/write-integration-manifest.mjs with its own tests.
#
# Inputs, all read from the environment (none positional):
#   WORKSPACE                     the run's checkout, and the parent of .pipeline-artifacts (required)
#   BUILD_SOURCEVERSION           the immutable revision this run is pinned to (required)
#   BUILD_BUILDID                 the globally unique run id, used for cache cohorts (required)
#   BUILD_PIPELINE_RUNNUMBER      the per-pipeline counter; falls back to BUILD_BUILDID (optional)
#   AETHEUS_CACHE_SCENARIO        warm (shared cache) or cold (per-run cache); defaults to warm
#   DELIVERY_BASELINE_SOURCE_SHA  the last delivered revision, to skip unaffected optional packages
#   DELIVERY_BASELINE_BOOTSTRAP   passed through to the delivery contract; defaults to true
#   AETHEUS_BUILDX_BUILDER        the buildx builder name; defaults to aetheus-$HOSTNAME
#
# Publishes OPTIONAL_OBSERVABILITY_AFFECTED as a run output variable.
