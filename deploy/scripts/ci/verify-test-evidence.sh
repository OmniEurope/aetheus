# Verifies that each suite actually left the evidence it claimed, and publishes the unit-test
# aggregate the assurance contract records.
#
# What this keeps from the old publish-blocking-test-gate.sh is only what is specific to this
# repository: where each suite writes its TRX and its Cobertura reports. Deciding what the statuses
# add up to, and blocking on that, is now the `type: gate-status` step that follows (PLAN-006 lot
# 11.3) - the rule that a status nobody published counts as a failure is exactly the one a project
# rewriting this in shell gets backwards, so it does not belong in shell.
#
# UNIT_TEST_GATE_STATUS is still published here, and still means the THREE unit suites only. The
# analyzer suite is graded as its own entry of the assurance contract, so folding it in would
# silently change what that contract asserts.
#
# Inputs, all read from the environment (none positional):
#   BACK_TEST_STATUS, FRONT_TEST_STATUS, AGENT_TEST_STATUS
#     the unit suites' statuses; each defaults to failing when absent, because a status nobody
#     published must not read as a pass
