# Smokes the retained V-1 binary against the schema V produced and turns its verdict into an advisory

# reporting a pass nothing produced.

# Inputs, all read from the environment (none positional):
#   WORKSPACE     the run's checkout, holding .qa-bootstrap-mode and .qa-admin-pwd
#   QA_PORT_BACK  the run-scoped backend port this QA stack listens on. It was written `$(...)` in
#                 the YAML, which the control plane substitutes in a `shell:` block; inside a script
#                 that same text is a shell command substitution, so the caller passes it by name.
