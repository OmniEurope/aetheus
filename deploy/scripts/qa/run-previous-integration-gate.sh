# Runs the retained V-1 integration suites, in-tree then against the deployed backend, and turns
# their verdicts into one advisory gate status. In bootstrap mode there is no retained V-1 and it
# attests that instead of reporting a pass nothing produced.
#
# Exit code 10 means a suite found something, which downgrades the gate to 1 without failing the
# step; any other non-zero code is a real failure and propagates.

# Inputs, all read from the environment (none positional):
#   WORKSPACE     the run's checkout, holding .qa-bootstrap-mode, .nminus1-source and .qa-admin-pwd
#   QA_PORT_BACK  the run-scoped backend port this QA stack listens on. It was written `$(...)` in
#                 the YAML, which the control plane substitutes in a `shell:` block; inside a script
#                 that same text is a shell command substitution, so the caller passes it by name.
