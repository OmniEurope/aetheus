# Runs the V integration suites, in-tree then against the deployed backend, and turns their verdicts
# into one advisory gate status. Exit code 10 means a suite found something, which downgrades the
# gate to 1 without failing the step; any other non-zero code is a real failure and propagates.

# This was 13 lines inlined in .pipeline/aetheus-qa.yaml. The body is relocated unchanged apart from
# QA_PORT_BACK, noted below.

# Inputs, all read from the environment (none positional):
#   WORKSPACE     the run's checkout, holding .qa-admin-pwd
#   QA_PORT_BACK  the run-scoped backend port this QA stack listens on. It was written `$(...)` in
#                 the YAML, which the control plane substitutes in a `shell:` block; inside a script
#                 that same text is a shell command substitution, so the caller passes it by name.
