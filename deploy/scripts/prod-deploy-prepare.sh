# Everything the production environment needs BEFORE the native blue-green steps act on it.
#
# The cutover - migrate, start the idle colour, move traffic, probe, commit, roll back - belongs to
# the `bluegreen-*` and `smoke` step types through the host-bluegreen-deploy template. What stays here
# is what those types deliberately do not know about, because it is specific to THIS environment
# rather than to blue-green deployment:
#
#   1. the provenance contract: this workflow runs from the protected branch, and the payload it is
#      about to deploy is the immutable candidate that was sealed, not a local rebuild;
#   2. the production state directory, which lives outside the tree an agent reinstall purges;
#   3. secret-zero, which is reused verbatim and NEVER regenerated while persistent state exists;
#   4. the payload, loaded as images tagged by revision and verified against those tags;
#   5. the run variables Compose interpolates, and the run-local upstream template the switch renders.
#
# It performs no cutover and holds no transaction: a failure here leaves the live colour serving.
