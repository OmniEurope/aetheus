#   render-env-sample.sh SAMPLE
#
# The template names every key, in order; this script only resolves the placeholders it declares,
# so the repository holds the shape of the file and the host alone holds its secrets. Each
# non-comment line is KEY=VALUE, and VALUE is either a literal copied as is or exactly one of:
#   #{PUBLIC_API_URL}# #{PUBLIC_APP_URL}# #{APP_VERSION}#   the run value of that name, non-empty
#   #{SECRET_HEX_<N>}#                                      `openssl rand -hex <N>`, generated here
# Anything else that looks like a placeholder, a duplicate key, a malformed line or an empty result
# fails the whole render: the caller writes nothing rather than a partial environment.
