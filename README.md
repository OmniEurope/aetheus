**Aetheus** is a self-hosted infrastructure and CI/CD platform: a central server, distributed
agents on your own machines, and a web dashboard. You define pipelines in YAML, run them on
your fleet, deploy the result, and watch what you deployed, all from one place.

## Features

**CI/CD pipelines**
- YAML pipelines with stages, jobs, steps and triggers (manual, webhook, scheduled).
- Agent pools, per-stage target selection, and cross-agent job dispatch.
- Artifacts with configurable retention, run logs, and a visual pipeline editor.
- Native blue-green deployment steps, binary symlink-flip or container compose, with smoke gates and rollback.

**Fleet and agents**
- .NET worker-service agents for Linux (systemd) and Windows (Windows Service).
- Pull model: HTTP polling for work, SignalR over WebSocket for real time.
- Non-root by default with opt-in capabilities chosen at install time.
- Metric collectors for the host and its services.

**Deployed-application monitoring**
- Availability probing from an agent or from the backend, for on-fleet and off-fleet apps.
- Optional OTLP ingestion of metrics, logs and errors, with a per-application ingestion key.

**Projects, secrets and access**
- Organizations, projects, environments, and per-resource authorization with administrable roles.
- Variable libraries scoped to a project, environment or project-server.
- Vaults holding AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets, masked in every output.
- JWT authentication with refresh-token rotation, TOTP two-factor, and account lockout.
- SHA-256 hash-chained audit log, append-only at the database level, with a tamper-detection endpoint.

**Quality tooling**
- Built-in code analysis campaigns: coverage, duplication, complexity and security rules.
- Custom Roslyn analyzers shipped with the solution.
- Optional packages for OpenTelemetry (`Aetheus.Telemetry`) and privacy-preserving web analytics
  (`Aetheus.WebAnalytics`, plus a browser package under `packages/`).

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK, version 10.0.202 or later. `global.json` prefers the 10.0.2xx feature band.
- Docker and Docker Compose, for the local database and for container deployment.
- Playwright browsers, only for E2E tests:
  `pwsh bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install` from `tests/Aetheus.E2E/`.

### Launch

The repository ships one launcher per platform. They build the solution, start a local
PostgreSQL container, run the backend and the frontend, and keep test databases isolated.

**Windows**

```powershell
.\launch-windows.ps1          # build, start API (5301) + front (5401), open the browser
.\launch-windows.ps1 -s       # same, without opening a browser
.\launch-windows.ps1 -r       # reset the database with a fresh seed, then start
.\launch-windows.ps1 -hr      # start with hot reload (dotnet watch)
.\launch-windows.ps1 -hl      # detailed help with examples
```

**Linux**

```bash
./launch-linux.sh             # build and start the stack
./launch-linux.sh -s          # start without opening a browser
./launch-linux.sh -hl         # detailed help with examples
```

### Tests

Both launchers expose the same test flags:

```bash
./launch-linux.sh -t          # unit tests, including the analyzer suite
./launch-linux.sh -ti         # integration tests on Testcontainers PostgreSQL
./launch-linux.sh -te         # Playwright E2E tests on an isolated ephemeral database
./launch-linux.sh -tec <name> # E2E tests filtered by category
./launch-linux.sh -ta         # everything: unit, integration and E2E
./launch-linux.sh -c          # tests with the coverage report and its gate
```

### Without the launchers

```bash
dotnet build Aetheus.slnx
dotnet run --project src/Aetheus.Back    # https://localhost:5301
dotnet run --project src/Aetheus.Front   # https://localhost:5401
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Backend API | `https://localhost:5301`, OpenAPI at `/openapi/v1.json` |
| Frontend (Blazor WebAssembly) | `https://localhost:5401` |
| SignalR hubs | `https://localhost:5301/hubs/*` |
| Health | `/health` authenticated, `/health/live` and `/health/ready` anonymous |

## Installing an agent

**Linux**

```bash
sudo sh deploy/scripts/install-agent-linux.sh
# prompts for the server URL and a registration token, then creates a systemd service
```

**Windows**

Download the agent archive from the Aetheus UI, or from
`{SERVER_URL}/downloads/aetheus-agent-win-x64.zip`, extract it, then run from inside it:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install-agent-windows.ps1
```

## Deployment

```powershell
.\deploy\scripts\local.ps1            # local Docker stack: build and start
.\deploy\scripts\local.ps1 -Down      # stop it
```

```bash
sh deploy/scripts/deploy.sh           # remote Linux deployment, production, branch main
sh deploy/scripts/deploy.sh -b develop
sh deploy/scripts/deploy.sh -r        # rebuild without cache
sh deploy/scripts/deploy.sh -d        # stop
```

`deploy/apache/` holds reverse-proxy templates using `example.com` placeholders. Replace the
`ServerName` values and the certificate paths with your own before use.
