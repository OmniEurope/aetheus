/// A360-43. The sixty existing E2E tests exercise the interface; not one of them ever LAUNCHED a
/// pipeline, so the whole launch path - preparation, parameter resolution, variable resolution,
/// preflight, refusal or persistence - had no end-to-end coverage at all. Every test of it ran against
/// mocks.
///
/// Scope, stated plainly: this does not run a pipeline to completion. That needs an enrolled agent
/// online, and the E2E harness starts a backend, a frontend and a dedicated database - no agent. What
/// it does cover end to end, through the real HTTP stack and the real database, is everything up to
/// the point where an agent would be needed: a pipeline whose stage names a runner nobody is
/// configured for must be REFUSED at launch, with a readable reason, instead of being accepted and
/// dying at its first stage.
///
/// That refusal is the behaviour added this week (the launch-time preflight), and it was the one part
/// of it no test could observe for real.
