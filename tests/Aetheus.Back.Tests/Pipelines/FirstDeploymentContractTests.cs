/// A deployment to an EMPTY environment is the one case the self-deploy path had never taken, and it
/// could not have succeeded. Reproduced end to end against a local agent: every stage passed and only
/// the blocking Evidence gate failed, on two compounding causes.
///
///   The smoke demanded business data. A freshly deployed control plane runs with
///   ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production, so neither Seed__Demo nor Seed__ConformanceToto applies and it
///   holds no projects. Asserting projectCount > 0 made "the environment is new" indistinguishable
///   from "the deployment is broken".
///
///   The instance was then unreachable. The run-scoped identity travelled as ADMIN_USER/ADMIN_PASSWORD,
///   and DbInitializer hashes Auth:AdminPassword into the persisted `admin` on a first run - so the
///   environment got a permanent administrator whose password was that run's throwaway secret, which
///   the run masks out of its own log. Observed on the deployed container:
///   Auth__AdminUser=deploy-smoke-7d1c1f5bd9ebf49a, expiring ten minutes after the cutover.
///
/// These read the shipped files, because both causes live in wiring rather than in code paths a unit
/// test reaches, and nothing else exercises the first-deployment path.
