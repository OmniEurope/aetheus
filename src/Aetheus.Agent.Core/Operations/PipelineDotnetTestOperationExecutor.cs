/// PLAN-006 lot 11.3: runs one .NET test project and publishes a CLASSIFIED gate status.
///
/// The reason this is a typed step rather than a shell one is the classification, not the command.
/// `dotnet test` is three lines of shell; deciding whether its result is a finding or a broken run
/// is a rule that every project rewrites and gets subtly wrong, because the obvious shell form
/// (`dotnet test || exit 1`) makes a crashed test host look exactly like an honest regression, and a
/// run that executed zero tests look exactly like a clean one.
///
/// So the step never fails on the runner's exit code alone. It reconciles that code against the TRX
/// the run produced, and publishes 0 (clean) or 1 (findings) as a run variable the gate reads. Only
/// evidence it cannot trust at all makes the step itself fail.
/// </summary>
