/// PLAN-006 lot 11.3: aggregates statuses published by earlier steps into one verdict.
///
/// The comparison is trivial; what is worth typing is the absent case. A status nobody published
/// must read as a FAILURE, never as a pass, and shell defaults the other way: an unset variable
/// expands to the empty string, so the natural `[ "$STATUS" = 0 ]` is false, `[ "$STATUS" != 1 ]` is
/// true, and which of those a project wrote decides whether a gate silently passes on evidence that
/// never arrived. That is the worst way for a gate to fail, because it fails green.
///
/// A value that is neither 0 nor 1 is refused outright rather than counted as a failure: it means
/// the producing step wrote something nobody expected, and a gate that quietly rounds unknown input
/// to "failed" hides that just as surely as one that rounds it to "passed".
