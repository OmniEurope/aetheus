# Third-party notices

This repository uses third-party packages under their respective licenses. Package versions are centrally declared in `Directory.Packages.props`. CI enforces vulnerability scans and project SPDX headers; the redistributed-dependency license inventory is reviewed manually and is not currently protected by a fail-closed CI guard.
